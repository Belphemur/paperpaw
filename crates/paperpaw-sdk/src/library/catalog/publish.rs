//! What a first walk found so far, shown as it goes on: a walk that
//! begins where there is no catalog yet (books copied onto a new card,
//! thousands of them) puts the books it found into the catalog at
//! checkpoints, so that they are listed and can be read at once rather
//! than after the walk. The building file is written as always; the
//! catalog takes what was added to it since the last checkpoint, whole
//! lines a piece a step. At its end the walk adds the rest: the catalog
//! is what the building file was, byte for byte, as a walk that never
//! published puts it in place. Cut off (the power gone), the catalog is
//! the books found until then, its last line maybe cut short, and the
//! next walk compares with it and makes it whole as with any other.
