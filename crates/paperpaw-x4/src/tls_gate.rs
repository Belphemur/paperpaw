//! How many TLS sessions the firmware holds at once, and who is next when
//! all are held. A session takes some 40 KiB of heap while it is open (and
//! 8 to 12 KiB more during its handshake), so the X4 (ESP32-C3) holds one
//! and the X4 Pro and Classic (ESP32-S3) two. HTTPS requests and plugins'
//! TLS sockets share them: whoever asked first is served first.
//!
//! The gate only counts: tickets are asked for, taken in turn and given
//! back; what holds one is the firmware's.
