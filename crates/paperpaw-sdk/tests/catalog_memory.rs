//! Making the catalog of a large library takes a few kilobytes, whatever
//! its size, on a FAT card as the X4's: a walk reads the old catalog along
//! with it instead of holding it (and takes every book from it), lists
//! folders a piece a step, and writes a few books a step; catching up
//! copies the old catalog a piece at a time. With a long log of status
//! changes and full lists of favourites and books opened (the X4 has
//! about 192 KiB of heap in all, the library's index of 2000 books 48 KB
//! of it).
