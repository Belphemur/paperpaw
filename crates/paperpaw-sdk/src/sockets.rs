//! What plugins' sockets are set up with and fail by: TLS (implicit, as
//! IMAPS on 993, or switched to on an open socket, as STARTTLS), the
//! certificates trusted, and why a socket failed
//! ([ADR 0014](https://github.com/hthoene/paperpaw/blob/main/docs/adr/0014-sockets-for-plugins.md)).
//!
//! A plugin gets TLS as it is, bytes in and out after the handshake: what
//! it speaks over it is its own. The server's certificate is checked
//! against the authorities PaperPaw ships unless the plugin pins the
//! certificates or keys it trusts instead ([`Trust`]).
//!
//! *Valid now* is checked where the device knows the time. Where it does
//! not yet (no clock that kept it, no network time since a cold start),
//! everything else is checked and the socket says so
//! ([`SocketNotice::Secured`](crate::SocketNotice::Secured)'s
//! `time_checked`): a plugin that must not trust an expired certificate
//! closes and tries again once the clock is set. Failing instead would
//! keep an X4 from every server just after it starts.
