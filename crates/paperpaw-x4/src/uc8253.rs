//! The Xteink X3's display: a 792 × 528 panel driven by an UltraChip
//! UC8253 over SPI, with the same calls as [`uc8179`](crate::uc8179), so
//! the firmware drives it alike.
//!
//! The X3 has no memory for a frame of its own: the controller keeps it,
//! in two memories, the new frame (`DTM2`) and the one shown (`DTM1`),
//! which a fast refresh compares with. [`Display::write_rows`] writes
//! PaperPaw's bands straight into them, each through a window of the
//! controller's memory (`PTL`, entered with `PTIN` and left with
//! `PTOUT`), into the memories [`Planes`] names. After every refresh the
//! firmware writes the frame shown into both again, so the one shown is
//! there for the next fast refresh.
//!
//! The controller's memory is 528 lines (gates) of 792 columns (sources),
//! a byte 8 pixels of a line, the leftmost in the highest bit, set for
//! white: 52,272 bytes. PaperPaw draws the screen upright (528 × 792): the
//! panel turned clockwise, as the X4's, the screen's column `x` the
//! controller's line `x`, its row `y` the controller's column `y`.
//!
//! The panel's own memory of waveforms is blank, so every refresh loads
//! its waveforms into the controller's registers first (`0x20` to `0x24`:
//! VCOM, then for each pixel by its bit in the shown and the new frame,
//! white to white, black to white, white to black, black to black).
//! These are the FreeInk SDK's: full (its stock waveform), half (driving
//! every pixel to its new colour) and fast (only where the two frames
//! differ). The SDK drives a full refresh from a white frame shown; here
//! the full waveform is loaded for both of a new colour's registers, so
//! the frame shown does not matter and stays as it is. After a full
//! refresh the SDK settles the panel with a gentle pass before the next
//! fast one ("the first differential after a full garbles"); here that
//! pass comes at the start of the next fast refresh, from the frame shown.
//!
//! Four grays ([`Display::write_gray_rows`], [`Display::refresh_gray`])
//! are shown in black and white. The SDK's grays on the UC8253 first show
//! the frame in black and white, then the two bits of each gray in both
//! memories: that takes the frame twice, which the X3 does not keep, and
//! a waveform that prepares the panel for them taken from the stock
//! firmware, which is not used here.
